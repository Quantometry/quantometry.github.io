# Introduction

You have probably seen one of these fish symbol stickers on some cars, or on the streets' graffiti: 

![fish](static/images/fish.jpg)

This is Icthus symbol in Christianity, also known as Vesica Piscis, and is a repeating pattern in
Christian paintings of Jesus and saints. In this project we explore how this pattern formalized as 
a mathematical constant stretches beyond a particular religion and into the realm of universal, 
sacred geometry.

# Finding where the fish came from...

## So, what's this about?
We are a couple of quantum enthusiasts exploring a logical system where specific
relationships between numerically related algebric equations generates an easily
recognizable sphere theory.

Jason Chewning (Nymphoton) has explored these curves from the equations for the 
past 5 years, and explains the logical system in layman terms:

The square root of three is a constant that can be geometrically and trigonometrically 
identified, measured, represented. [link text:"The Vesica Piscis is simply y = x / sqrt(3)," href:"https://www.geomancy.org/index.php/sacred-geometry/square-root-3" /] 
and the logic system is an iteration of that constant. All the algebraic iterations in the
logic system, when fully simplified, all comes down to `y = x / sqrt(3)`.
However when one starts off un-simplified version, one could alter 
the algebra and produce a number of distinctly related curves.

For instance, currently all the logic system is recorded in Geogebra in this way:

Taking above sample equation as U(x), then the entire spectrum of curves is:

* U(x) = 2sqrt((1/3x)^2) - (1/6x)^2 => positive function
* -U(x) => negative function
* 1/U(x) => reciprocal function
* -1/U(x) => negative reciprocal function
* +- x^U(x) => variable root function
* +- U(x)^x => variable exponent function
* +- Cos(x^(U(x))) ... all trigonmentric functions

Mapping it out yields the image below:

Stunning, but what does this mean? That's what we're trying to find out.
Jason has first classified a bunch of iterations he did over the years into
a "gate system" outlined below:

So the previous example was an example of 'Splayed trio', as you can see three
distict circles not touching each other.

### Opposed-Duo

# Next steps...
We will be
* adding a little interactive component using Idyll for a small sandbox-like environment to fiddle around on this website
* developing a backend engine to simulate more diverse iterations of these algebraic expressions;
* i.e plugging in coefficients, recording subsequent data and seeing where the graph fits into the gate system category, seeing how / where it changes in category as the parameters change.
